Bugs
-Cannot place ships in between two ships, even for valid locations at certain times. Seems like it thinks the ship
 to be placed is colliding with the two on it's sides.
-Still printing "Press R to rotate" when game starts
-Player1 cannot rotate his first ship
-IMPORTANT! When you rotate a ship while placing it, the middle of the ship becomes the placement point.
-Once 2 players placed their ships, player2's board has a highlighted block shows player2's ship location,
it desappears next turn
