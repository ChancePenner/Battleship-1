      *Then type in the path you copied: cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
      *Type in: sudo rm -fr /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkXXXX.jdk(deleating path, if you have multiple jdk version installed,
       use commands to delete them all and make sure there is nothing left in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines)
